# Basic-Penetration-Testing-Skills

This repository contains **four individual mini-projects** focused on network communication using Python and socket programming:

1. **TCP Server & Client**
2. **Nmap Scanner**
3. **Banner Grabber**
4. **Port Scanner**

Each project demonstrates foundational networking concepts such as socket communication, service discovery, and port scanning.
